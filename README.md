# 2nd-Python-Game
This was my 2nd game I create in early October. It is a number guessing game.
This is a number guessing game where the program will pick a random number between 1 and 1000.
It will ask you for a guess and in response will tell you Lower or Higher so you can adjust your guess.
It also keeps count of how many guesses it takes.
